            that's why I made Day Hop! An app that lets you write a tweet sized post about what you did on a particular day. 
            Give it a title, give it a body, (change the date if you forgot to post yesterday..) and you're all set.
            BUT WAIT! THERE IS MORE! You can also see what post you made on any day a year ago... and the year before that... and the year before that.</p>
