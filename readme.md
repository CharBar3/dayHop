# Day Hop

Can you remember your life? I can't, that's why I made Day Hop! An app that lets you write a tweet-sized post about what you did on a particular day.

BUT WAIT! THERE IS MORE! You can also see what post you made on any day a year ago... and the year before that... and the year before that... etc.

## Technologies Used

1. Django
2. Python
3. PostgreSQL
4. HTML
5. Materialize CSS
6. Heroku
